# about

chrome extension for forcing book-style reading of manga on mangasee123

## install

- clone repo
- navigate to manage your chrome extensions
  - Load unpacked
  - choose dir with this project

## usage

when on a chapter page ([example](https://mangasee123.com/read-online/Sakamoto-Days-chapter-1.html)) click the extension to reformat the page

## issues

- doesn't let you advance to next chapter using the navbar
  - workaround: refresh page after advancing to next chapter

this is basically in a *good enough* state. I can't guarantee that this is even working, so if the reading experience is goofed up, don't be too surprised.
